# AbaloneAgeML
Overview
This project involves analyzing and predicting the age of abalones based on physical measurements using the Abalone Dataset.
The goal is to process the dataset, explore its structure, and utilize various machine learning models for regression and classification tasks.
Rings, is used as the main target variable to calculate age (Age = Rings + 1.5 years).

Dataset Information
